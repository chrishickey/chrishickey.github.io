I am a software engineer and AI researcher, currently looking for new job opportunities.  I specialise in Python with four years professional industry experience and have recently graduated from Seoul National University studying Engineering through Cognitive Science. Through this Masters of Science in Engineering program, I gained expertise regarding the development of neurologically inspired systems to solve real world AI problems. My research is currently focused on investigating similarities between humans and neural networks in cognitive problems and cognitive universalities.
