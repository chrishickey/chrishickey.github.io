I am a software engineer from Ireland, specialising in Python with four years professional industry experience, currently looking for new job opportunities. After spending a year studying Korean, I recently graduated from Seoul National University studying Engineering through Cognitive Science. Through this Masters of Science in Engineering program, I am gaining expertise regarding the development of neurologically inspired systems to solve real world AI problems. My research is currently focused on investigating similarities between humans and neural networks in cognitive problems and cognitive universalities.
